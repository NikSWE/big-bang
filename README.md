You might be wondering at first does this repository belong to __NASA__ or __ISRO__, well it doesn't (_for atleast now_) and if you didn't think so then good for you (_you will get an apointment letter soon_).

Jokes apart this repo has a very straight forward purpose that is to _help quickly setup a brand new **laptop || desktop**_ with the packages you need.

# Inspiration
* _Migration_ from one OS to another
* _Upgrading / Downgrading_ my system (twice a day)
* Creating a _virtual garbage dumpyard_ on my system
* Purchasing a _Brand New_ system

You might say I'm crazy and honestly I would accept it, but deep down I know you have faced these issues too.

# How to Use it ?
Run the following commands in the terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muj-programmer/big-bang.git

cd big-bang

sh big-bang.sh
```
Thats it, Now you have the time to complete all the chores you have been putting off or catch up on the TV series you left in the middle.

# Can I Configure it ?
Yes, you are in complete control of the setup process.

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muj-programmer/big-bang.git
```
2. Go to config directory
```bash
cd big-bang/config
```
3. Open the right config file
```bash
# For Mac OSX
vim osx_config.json

# For Linux
vim linux_config.json

# For Windows
vim windows_config.json
```

Just add (+) or subtract (-) packages in the opened file.

**P.S** It's totally fine if you don't edit the config file, this will install the packages that I use (give it a try you might like it)
